# Facebook - CodePath Homework #4

This is my homework #4 submission for the CodePath iOS for Designers course. It demonstrates the Facebook newsfeed action of viewing a photo and the swipe to dismiss action.

 **Time spent:** 7 hours spent in total
 
 **Required user stories:**
 * Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
 * Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
 * On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
 * If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.

**Walkthrough of all user stories:**
